# Algorithm-Visualizer
This project aims to develop an Algorithm Visualizer that demonstrates the inner workings 
of Insertion Sort, Bubble Sort, and Selection Sort using the Python programming language 
and the Flet library. The visualizer will allow users to input arrays manually, or generate 
random arrays of different sizes. Once an array is selected, users can choose from the three 
sorting algorithms to visualize the sorting process in real time. The tool will feature two 
modes for visualization: auto-sort mode, where the sorting happens automatically, and step
wise mode, where the user can proceed through each sorting step manually. The visualizer 
will also provide a graph displaying the array elements, and the time complexity of the 
sorting process will be displayed dynamically, allowing users to analyze how each algorithm 
performs with various input sizes. This project is aimed at helping students, developers, and 
educators understand sorting algorithms in a clear and interactive manner.
